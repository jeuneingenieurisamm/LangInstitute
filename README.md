# LangInstitute

LangInsitute is a simple management application for a language institute,

Using this app, the employee responsible for the registration of new students can add, update, and delete a student, and he can also display the list of the enrolled students,
Similarly he can add, update and delete a language course, and he can as well display the list of the available courses.

This is the first commit and contains the routing configuration that we've seen during the second training session (20/10/2017) plus a simple template based on AngularMaterial UIs.
